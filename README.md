### Dog Breed Classification

This project focuses on classifying images of dogs into their respective breeds using deep learning techniques. The core of the system is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is highly effective for image classification tasks. The project aims to automate the recognition of dog breeds from images, making it applicable in various domains such as animal care and pet identification systems.

### Features

**Dataset**: The model uses a collection of dog images categorized by breed. These images are preprocessed, resized, and augmented to improve model performance.

**Model Architecture**: A CNN is designed with multiple convolutional layers to learn features from images. These layers are followed by pooling layers to reduce dimensions and fully connected layers to make the final breed predictions.

**Training**: The model is trained on a labeled dog image dataset using an appropriate loss function and optimizer. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy and loss are used to monitor the training progress.

**Results**: The model is capable of classifying dog breeds from unseen images, displaying both the predicted breed and the confidence level of the prediction.

### Steps Involved

1. **Data Preparation**: The images are resized to a uniform size, and augmentation techniques like rotation and flipping are applied to create a diverse dataset.
   
2. **Model Architecture**: The CNN consists of several layers to capture important features from the images, followed by fully connected layers to make predictions.

3. **Training the Model**: The model is trained with labeled images, optimizing for accuracy and minimizing loss over several epochs.

4. **Evaluation**: After training, the model is evaluated using a validation dataset to ensure its ability to generalize to unseen data.

5. **Prediction & Visualization**: Once the model is trained, it predicts the breed of dogs from new images, which are visualized alongside the predicted breed and the confidence score.

### Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for implementation.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Libraries for building and training the CNN model.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for visualizing training results and predictions.
